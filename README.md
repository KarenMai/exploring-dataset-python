Many applications today provide a high level user interface that allows one to ask questions about some large (and often dynamically changing) dataset.  The registrar's website for scheduling our courses is one such application, but so is facebook, amazon, ebay, spotify, and almost all other applications we use everyday.  In this assignment, we got practice loading a large dataset into Python and then answering questions about the dataset using Python with the Jupyter interface, which is a common way to explore a new dataset. We worked on a Python script/class to create a course search application.

Another very common feature of any software development project is that it typically involves several developers collaborating using various tools (e.g. git) to design, develop, debug, and test a new software product. This assignment required us to create a shared repository with our team and to have everyone in the team contribute some code to the project. For this project, we worked on one branch. From this assignment, we learned how to collaborate using git and similar tools is a critical skill for modern software developers.
